# This revision presents a novel code version

# Arithmetic operation
alpha = 21
beta = 6
power_ab = alpha ** beta  # Switched to exponent operator
print(f'{alpha} to the power of {beta} is: {power_ab}')

# List operations
alt_list = [8, 16, 24]
alt_list.reverse()  # Changed to reverse the list
print(f'Reversed list is: {alt_list}')

# Conditional
if alpha <= beta:
    print('alpha is less than or equal to beta')
else:
    print('alpha exceeds beta')  # New else branch

# Loop
for symbol in ['x', 'y', 'z']:
    print(f'New symbol in loop: {symbol}')  # Output string changed

# Function
def identifier(name):
    print(f'Your identifier is: {name[::-1]}')  # Reverses and prints name

identifier('Analyst')
