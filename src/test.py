# This Python file is now revised again

# Arithmetic operation
num1 = 100
num2 = 50
quotient = num1 / num2  # Changed to division
print(f'Quotient of num1 and num2 is: {quotient}')

# List operations
demo_list = [99, 77, 55]
demo_list.pop()  # Changed operation to remove the last element
print(f'List after pop: {demo_list}')

# Conditional
if num1 != num2:
    print('num1 and num2 are different')
else:
    print('num1 and num2 are the same')  # Different branching logic

# Loop
for idx in range(2):
    print(f'Third loop run: {idx}')  # Changed loop and output

# Function
def shout(name):
    print(f'HEY, {name.upper()}!')  # Function now shouts back

shout('Builder')
